			  <h2>Cataracts and No Stitch/Small Incision Surgery</h2>

			  <p class="autop">Although the formation of a cataract can make activities such as reading and driving difficult, good vision can be safely restored with outpatient cataract surgery.  Today, with the development of no stitch/small incision cataract surgery, many patients are experiencing a faster recovery and a quicker return to good vision.</p>

			  <img src="images/cataracts1.jpg" class="floatRight" alt="Cataracts vs. Normal Vision">

<h3>What is a cataract?</h3>

<p class="autop">A cataract is the clouding of the lens of the eye.  Normally, light passes through the clear lens and is focused onto the retina.  However, as a result of the natural aging process, the lens gradually becomes cloudy.  The cataract or cloudy lens blocks the passage of light through the eye and causes distorted or blurred vision.</p>



<h3>How Do Cataracts Form?</h3>

<p class="autop">Cataracts form when your natural lens loses its elasticity and hardens. This is a natural process, which is why aging is the number one cause of cataracts.</p>

<h3>What Are the Beginning Signs of Cataracts?</h3>

<p class="autop">Gradual blurring of your vision always accompanies developing cataracts. You may also experience glare in bright light or colors may begin to fade. Cataracts do not cause pain or sudden vision loss.</p>

<h3>How Are Cataracts Treated?</h3>

<p class="autop">Surgical removal of the cataract and the implementation of an artificial lens is the only treatment for a Cataract. However, technological advances have afforded patients with the restoration of their vision.</p>

<p class="autop">During cataract surgery, the clouded natural lens is dissolved and replaced with a plastic foldable intraocular lens ( IOL ). Interestingly, Dr. Stephen Brint was the first in Louisiana to perform this surgery in 1985. The IOL's used over the last 30 years are called standard monofocal IOL’s because their focus is set to provide distance or  near vision, but not both. Patients who receive a standard monofocal IOL usually still need to wear glasses to achieve the clearest focus for distance and near objects because of astigmatism or presbyopia.</p>

<h3>Astigmatism</h3>

<p class="autop">About half of the population is born with corneas that are shaped in a way which create astigmatism. If you have astigmatism, and you want to see clearly in the distance, you need to wear glasses or contact lenses. Recently, a new style of IOL called a toric IOL was introduced. The toric IOL can correct, or at least partially correct your naturally occurring corneal astigmatism so you won’t be so dependent of glasses to see in the distance after cataract surgery.</p>

<h3>Presbyopia</h3>

<p class="autop">With time, almost everyone is affected by presbyopia. Presbyopia is a part of the normal aging process and happens to all of us. Presbyopia is caused by the loss of flexibility of the natural lens and the weakening of the lens’s focusing muscle. It becomes evident to most of us at about the age 45 and that’s why we have to start wearing reading glasses or need to begin wearing bifocals. We just can’t see up close without them. Everyone who undergoes cataract surgery with a  standard monofocal IOL needs to have to have reading glasses to see up close afterward because presbyopia is not treated by the standard monofocal IOL. But over the past few years, there have been several IOL’s introduced which correct presbyopia after cataract surgery. Patients who choose one of these presbyopia correcting IOL’s can usually see far away and up close without glasses. Dr. Brint was the first surgeon in Louisiana to use these new lenses as part of the FDA study over five years ago.</p>

<h3>What Are My Options?</h3>

<p class="autop">There are several factors that we take into consideration when selecting the best lens implant for out patients. Your lifestyle and hobbies will be a major consideration along with your desire to reduce your dependence on wearing glasses.</p>

<h3>What are no-stitch/small incision surgery techniques?</h3>

<p class="autop">No-stitch/small incision surgery are techniques used to restore vision loss due to cataracts.  The cloudy lens is removed and replaced with a plastic lens (IOL) implant.  Ultrasound technology (phacoemulsification) is often used to remove the cataract.  A special lens can then be implanted through a smaller incision than is required in traditional cataract surgery.</p>

<h3>What is phacoemulsification?</h3>

<p class="autop">Phacoemulsification (phaco) is a surgical technique which uses ultrasound technology.  In “phaco” or small incision surgery, a small probe is inserted into the capsular membrane which surrounds the cloudy lens.  Ultrasound is used to gently break-up (or emulsify) the cloudy lens into tiny pieces which can be removed through the tip of the probe.  In comparison, traditional surgery techniques require the lens to be removed in one piece through a relatively large incision.</p>

<p class="autop">Traditional cataract surgery requires an incision that spans a third of the circumference of the cornea and needs as many as eight stitches to close.  In contrast, the phaco technique allows the cloudy lens to be removed through as incision as small as 1/6 of an inch wide.</p>

<h3>No-stitch self sealing incision</h3>

<p class="autop">In many cases the incision can be closed with just one stitch.  In cases where the surgeon can use a technique that does not require sutures, the natural pressure inside the eye is used to keep the incision closed while the eye heals.</p>

<p class="autop">What are the advantages of no-stitch/small incision surgery? </p>

<ul class="cList">

<li>Faster recovery of good vision</li>

<li>Faster return to normal activities</li>

<li>Good vision in a matter of days instead of weeks or even months</li>

<li>Return home within hours of the procedure</li>

</ul>

<p class="autop">Reduces the chance of surgically induced astigmatism or ruptured sutures</li></p>

<p class="autop">No-stitch/small incision surgery not only speeds the healing and recovery process but also reduces the risk of possible complications.  In traditional surgery, tying the structures too tightly may create astigmatism or a distortion of vision.  The patient may experience blurred vision until natural healing corrects the astigmatism or rupture.  A no stitch/small incision can be closed very securely without causing astigmatism.  In addition, there is less chance of leakage and ruptured sutures.</p>

<h3>What results can be expected after no-stitch/small incision surgery</h3>

<img src="images/cataracts2.jpg" class="floatRight" alt="Cataracts Diagram">

<p class="autop">Most patients can expect a rapid return to good vision following no-stitch/small incision cataract surgery.  In many cases, patients are able to see relatively well the day after surgery without glasses.    However, some patients will need to wear glasses for reading and other activities following the procedure.  Quickly returning to an active lifestyle is one of the primary benefits of no stitch/small incision cataract surgery.  “Secondary” cataracts may develop following cataract surgery.  If this occurs an outpatient laser procedure will quickly restore good vision.</p>

<h3>Is no-stitch/small incision cataract surgery for everyone?</h3>

<p class="autop">With the no-stitch/small incision techniques, fewer or no stitches are needed than with traditional techniques.  However, the size of the incision and the number of stitches used varies from patient to patient.  Some patients, because of their eye structure or other health factors, are not good candidates for no-stitch/ small incision surgery.  In these cases, patients can have traditional surgery and expect to do well.</p>

<h3>Sight loss can be prevented</h3>

<p class="autop">Although there is no way to prevent the development of cataracts, loss of sight from the disease is largely preventable.  With modern technology, cataracts can be removed and good vision restored.  Cataract surgery can be performed when a loss of vision begins interfacing with daily activities.</p>

<p class="autop">If you are experiencing the symptoms of cataracts or other vision problems, you should obtain a complete eye examination.</p>

<h3>Options</h3>

<p class="autop">Depending on the results of your examination, you may have the option to choose a toric IOL, or a presbyopia correcting IOL, or you may choose a standard monofocal IOL. There is nothing wrong with electing the standard monofocal IOL, in fact most of our patients select this option either because they are not good candidates for the newer IOL’s or they don’t want to pay the additional costs associated with these technologies which Medicare and private insurance doesn’t cover. But the good news is, you now have some options, if not wearing glasses after cataract surgery is important to you.</p>

<p class="autop">We thank you for reading this introduction. During your visit you’ll have the opportunity to hear more about these choices to make your vision better. We look forward to your examination and to helping you learn more about these exciting new options.</p>
